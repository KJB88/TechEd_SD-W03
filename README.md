<h2>User Stories</h2>
  As a user...
<ul>
<li>I want to browse a set of thumbnail images that load quickly.</li>
  <li>I want to select a thumbnail and display a larger version of the image, with a description.</li>
  <li>I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images, and the ability to click next and previous buttons using the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>One page, with a set of thumbnail images, and a larger image.</li>
  <li>Styled appropriately with CSS, and make use of media queries (mobile responsive).</li>
  <li>Use client-side JS to display the larger image when a thumbnail is selected.</li>
  <li>Use client-side JS to navigate between images using the keyboard (tab, enter).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Keyboard Input</b>: Handle user interaction with keyboard only (as if they have no mouse). You can use tab and enter/space like for all websites. Possible use of also arrow keys.</li>
  <li><b>Voiceover Systems</b>: Use the OS's voiceover tools or a Screen Reader to have the computer announce the alt text of the selected image.</li>
  <li><b>Unsplash API</b>: Populate the images with calls to Unsplash.</li>
</ul>
